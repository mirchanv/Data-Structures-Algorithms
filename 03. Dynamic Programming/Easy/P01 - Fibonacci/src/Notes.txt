Memoization:
we tend to store the value of the sub-problems in some map/table/data structure, and if
that sub-problem is overlapping then we just return/reuse the previously stored value.
Instead of calculating it again.

Tabulation:
the direction of solving the problem is that we try to go from the base case to the
required answer!
