Problem Statement:
Given an array of N integers, left rotate the array by k places.

Example 1:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}, k=1
Output: 2,3,4,5,1
Explanation:
Since all the elements in array will be shifted toward left by k places so ‘2’ will
now become the first index and ‘1’ which was present at first index will be shifted at
last.


Example 2:
Input: N = 1, array[] = {3}, k=1
Output: 3
Explanation:
Here only element is present and so the element at first index will be shifted to last
index which is also by the way the first index.
