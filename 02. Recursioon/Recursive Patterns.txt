1. Recursive Pattern: to print all combinations, where you can pick the each element atmost once!
  - Idea here is simple, for each element we two options, either we pick the element or do not pick it

  - If we decide to pick the element, then:
      - Add the element to another data structure such as ArrayList
      - Now recusrively call the function again with next index
  
  - If we decide not to pick the element, then:
      - Remove last element from the ArrayList (because we picked it, so if we do not want to pick it remove it first)
      - Now recursively call the function again with next index

2. Recursive Pattern: to print any one combination
