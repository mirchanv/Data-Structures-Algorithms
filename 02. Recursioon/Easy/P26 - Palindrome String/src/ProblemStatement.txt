Problem Statement:
Given a string, find out if the string is palindromic using recursion. A String is said
to be palindromic if and only if it is the same from left to right and from right to
left.

For Example 1:
Input = RADAR
Output = true
Explanation:
    -> If we spell out or read out input from left-right we get RADAR
    -> If we spell out or read out input from right-left we get RADAR
    -> they are same, hence this is palindrome

For Example 2:
Input = MADAM
Output = true
Explanation:
    -> If we spell out or read out input from left-right we get MADAM
    -> If we spell out or read out input from right-left we get MADAM
    -> they are same, hence this is palindrome

For Example 3:
Input = BULB
Output = true
Explanation:
    -> If we spell out or read out input from left-right we get BULB
    -> If we spell out or read out input from right-left we get BLUB
    -> they are different, hence this is NOT a palindrome
