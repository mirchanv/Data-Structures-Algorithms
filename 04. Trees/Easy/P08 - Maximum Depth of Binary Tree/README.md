# Problem : Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
**Problem Statement:** 
Given the  `root`  of a binary tree, return  _its maximum depth_.

A binary tree's  **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Longest path is either [3, 20, 15] or [3, 20, 7] whichever we choose the result is the same that is 3. hence maximum depth of this binary tree is 3.
