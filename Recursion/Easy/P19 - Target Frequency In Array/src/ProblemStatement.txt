Problem Statement:
Given an array of ints and a target, compute recursively the number of times that the
target appears in the array. We'll use the convention of considering only the part of
the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1
to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.

Examples:
target = 11;
getFrequency([1, 2, 11], 0, target) → 1
getFrequency([11, 11], 0, target) → 2
getFrequency([1, 2, 3, 4], 0, target) → 0
