Problem Statement:
Given an array of ints and a target value, compute recursively if the array contains
the target value or not. We'll use the convention of considering only the part of the
array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1 to
move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.

Examples:
target = 6;
containsTarget([1, 6, 4], 0, target) → true
containsTarget([1, 4], 0, target) → false
containsTarget([6], 0, target) → true
